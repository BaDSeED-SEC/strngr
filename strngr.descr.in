strngr is a rewrite of the research tool "Stringer" described in the following publication:

"Stringer: Measuring the Importance of Static Data Comparisons to Detect Backdoors and Undocumented Functionality" by Sam L. Thomas, Tom Chothia and Flavio D. Garcia (University of Birmingham, UK).

strngr provides an ordering of functions and the static data used in comparisons that influence their control-flow. This ordering is intended to serve as a starting point for manual analysis when attempting to locate backdoor-like and undocumented functionality triggered by comparison with hard-coded static data, e.g., hard-coded credentials.
